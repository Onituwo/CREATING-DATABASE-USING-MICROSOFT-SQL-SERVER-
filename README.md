# CREATING-DATABASE-USING-MICROSOFT-SQL-SERVER-
This project is meant to showcase my Microsoft SQL Server.

## Introduction
A venture that i had working for, approached me to help them build their Employee Database, since they know that, i had acquired data analytic skills.

## Clauses And Concepts Applied include;

- CREATE
- INSERT 
- SELECT
- WHERE
- COUNT
- GROUP BY
- JOIN
- ORDER BY
- CASE
- UPDATE
- CONCAT
- UPPER
- LOWER

  ### In the Quary:
  

1. In the first Quary, I used the clause (CREATE) to create a Database named JADE_EMPLOYEE_DATA.

2. Then,i have to create a Table that will be inside the Database,
- So, I created the first table, Named JADE_EMPLOYEEDATA,
- Then i insert all the BIODATA of all the Employee working in the Venture, in which i used the Employee_ID as the primary key. 
 
- Then i used (SELECT ALL) Clause to check if all the information inputed into the Table are all correct.

3. The company also asked me to create another Table, that will contain the Salary,Jobtype,Jobtitle of all their Employee,
- In which i used the Employee_ID as the primary key, Because if maybe, i might need to relate the Tables together in the nearest future,
- And the Table is named JADE_EMPLOYEE_SALARY.

4. After some few weeks later, the Venture stakeholders asked me to Extract the names of all the Employee working in the Venture.

5. And also the stakeholder of the Venture asked me to Extract the Total Numbers of all the Males and Females Employee working in the Venture.

6. At the end of the second month, the stakeholder want to know the Name of the highest earner in the Venture. So i had to join the two Tables together to be able to Extract that information for them.

7. After the fifth month, the Company want to compensate their Employee by Raising their Salary based on categories set aside by the Venture stakeholders.

8. Then, the Manager approached me that he want to know the total numbers of Employee in each Jobtitle categories.

9. Then their is one of the Employee working in the Venture, that was single while i was creating the Database and now she's married, she confronted me to UPDATE her title into married in the Database. 

10. Then the secretary of the Venture want to prepare a circular to all the Employee working in the Venture and she approached me to help her with all the Employee's names writing in a normal format.
