# CREATING-DATABASE-USING-MICROSOFT-SQL-SERVER-
This project is meant to showcase my Microsoft SQL Server Skills.

## Introduction
A venture that i had worked for, approached me to help them build their Employee Database, since they know that, i have acquired data analytic skills.

## Clauses And Concepts Applied include;

- CREATE
- INSERT 
- SELECT
- WHERE
- COUNT
- GROUP BY
- JOIN
- ORDER BY
- CASE
- UPDATE
- CONCAT
- UPPER
- LOWER

  ### In the Quary:
  

1. In the first Quary, I used the clause to create a Database named JADE_EMPLOYEE_DATA.

2. Then, i have to create a Table that will be inside the Database,
- So, I created the first table, Named JADE_EMPLOYEEDATA,
- Then i inserted all the BIODATA of all the Employees working in the Venture into the table, in which i used the Employee_ID as the primary key. 
 
- Then i used (SELECT ALL) Clause to check if all the information inputed into the Table are all correct.

3. The company also asked me to create another Table that will contain the Salaries,Jobtypes,Jobtitles of all their Employees,
- In which i also used the Employee_ID as the primary key. Because i might need to relate the Tables together in the nearest future,
- And the Table is named JADE_EMPLOYEE_SALARY.

4. After a few weeks later, the Venture stakeholders asked me to Extract the names of all the Employees working in the Venture.

5. And also the stakeholders of the Venture asked me to Extract the Total Numbers of all the Males and Females Employees working in the Venture.

6. At the end of the second month, the stakeholders want to know the Name of the highest earner in the Venture. So i had to join the two Tables together to be able to Extract the required information for them.

7. And also after the fifth month, the Company want to compensate their Employees by Raising their Salary based on the categories of increament set aside to each of the jobtitle by the Venture stakeholders.

8. Then, the Manager approached me that he wants to know the total number of Employees in each of the Jobtitle categories.

9. Then there is one of the Employees working in the Venture, that was single while i was creating the Database and now she's married, she confronted me to UPDATE her title into married in the Database. 

10. Then the secretary of the Venture want to prepare a circular to all the Employees working in the Venture and she approached me to help her with all the names of the Employees written in normal format.
