A venture that i had worked for approached me to help them built their Employee Database, since they knoqw that, i had acquired data analyst skills.

## Clauses And Concepts Applied include;

- CREATE

- SELECT
- WHERE

- LOWER
  

1. In the first Quary, I use the syntax CREATE to create a Database named JADE_EMPLOYEE_DATA.

2. Then,i have to create a Table that will be inside the Database.So, i created the first table that will contain most of the BIODATA of all the Employee in the Venture and i named the Table JADE_EMPLOYEEDATA.

3. Then i used SELECT ALL Clause to check if all the information imported are all correct.

4. The company also asked me to create a Table that will contain the Salary,Jobtype,Jobtitle of there Employee. but i had to include the  Employee_ID, maybe i might need to relate the Tables together in the nearest future. And the Table is named JADE_EMPLOYEE_SALARY.

5. After some few weeks later, the Venture stakeholders asked me to Extract the names of all the Employee working in the Venture.

6. And also the stakeholder of the Venture also asked me to extract the total Number of the Males and Females Employee in the Venture.

7. At the end of the second month, the stakeholder want to know the Name of the Highest earner in the Venture. So i had to join the Two Tables together to be able to extract that information for them.

8. After the fifth month, the Company want to compensate their workers by Raising their Salary based on categories set aside by the Venture stakeholders.

9. Then they also want to know how many Employee are per each Jobtitle.

10. Then their is one of the Employee working in the Venture, that was single when i was creating the Database and she confronted me to UPDATE her title into married in the Database.

11. Then the secretary of the Venture want to prepare a circular to all the Employee working in the Venture and she approached me to help her with all the Employee's names writing in a normal format.
